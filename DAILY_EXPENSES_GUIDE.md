# Daily Expenses - Automatic Purchase Order Total Calculation

## Overview
The Daily Expenses page now automatically calculates and displays the total amount of all Purchase Orders for a selected date.

## How It Works

### 1. **Date Selection**
- When you select a date in the "Date" field, the system automatically:
  - Searches the Purchase Order database for all POs created on that date
  - Calculates the total amount of all POs found
  - Displays the total in the "Purchase Order Total" field

### 2. **Real-time Calculation**
- The calculation happens instantly when you change the date
- Shows a loading spinner while calculating
- Displays detailed breakdown of found POs

### 3. **Example Usage**
If you select date "2025-09-18" and there are:
- PO-1: ‚Çπ500
- PO-2: ‚Çπ450  
- PO-3: ‚Çπ310

The system will automatically show ‚Çπ1,260 in the Purchase Order Total field.
